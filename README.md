>**Note:** Multi-arch tags, such as 4.7.1, have been updated to use windowsservercore-1709 images if your host is Windows Server 1709 or higher or Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (Version 1709) or higher. You need Docker 17.10 or later to take advantage of these updated tags.

These images are updated via [pull requests to the `microsoft/aspnet-docker` GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/aspnet-docker/pulls).

# What is ASP.NET

ASP.NET is a high productivity framework for building Web Applications using Web Forms, MVC, Web API and SignalR.

This repository contains `Dockerfile` definitions for ASP.NET Docker images. These images use the [IIS image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iis/) as their base.

This image contains:
- Windows Server Core as the base OS
- IIS 10 as Web Server
- .NET Framework (multiple versions available)
- .NET Extensibility for IIS

# How to use these Images

Copy `4.7\sample\Dockerfile` to your app directory. You would then be able to build and run the site from the app directory.

```
$ docker build -t aspnet-site --build-arg site_root=/ .
$ docker run -d -p 8000:80 --name my-running-site aspnet-site
```

There is no need to specify an `ENTRYPOINT` in your Dockerfile since the `microsoft/aspnet` base image already includes an entrypoint application that monitors the status of the IIS World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3SVC).

### Verify in the browser

> With the current release, you can't use `http://localhost` to browse your site from the container host. This is because of a known behavior in WinNAT, and will be resolved in future. Until that is addressed, you need to use the IP address of the container.

Once the container starts, you'll need to finds its IP address so that you can connect to your running container from a browser. You use the `docker inspect` command to do that:

`docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}" my-running-site`

You will see an output similar to this:

```
172.28.103.186
```

You can connect the running container using the IP address and configured port, `http://172.28.103.186` in the example shown.
